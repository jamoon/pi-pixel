# What is a Circuit?
A circuit is a path between two or more points along which an electrical current can flow. The path may be closed (joined at both ends), making it a loop. A closed circuit makes electrical current flow possible. It may also be an open circuit where the electrical flow is cut short because the path is broken. An open circuit does not allow electrical current to flow.

# Resistors
Resistors are electronic components that have a specific electrical resistance. The resistor's resistance limits the flow of electricity through a circuit.  Resistors are used to limit electrical current.  The electrical resistance of a resistor is measured in ohms. The symbol for an ohm is the greek capital-omega: Ω


# Light-Emitting Diode
An LED is an electronic device that emits light when an electrical current is passed through it.  They are normally used to tell if your circuit has power.

# Bread Board
A thin plastic board used to hold electronic components that are wired together to create a circuits.

# Raspberry Pi
A small single circuit board computer

# Jump Wire
A jump wire (also known as jumper wire, or jumper) is an electrical wire, with a connector or pin at each end that is used to connect components on a breadboard.
